## **Project Description:**

> This website allows a user to build and manage their album collection using the Discogs API. It uses Node.js (hosted on Replit) and a MySQL server (hosted on Heroku) on the backend. Express.js is used as the templating engine. Styling is performed through Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS.
